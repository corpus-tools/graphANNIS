Data folder
===========

This folder can contain test or example data.

You have to copy it to the working directory from where you
execute the test binary. If you don't want to copy this folder
set the `ANNIS4_TEST_DATA` environment variable to this location.

Since the data can get quite big, we don't include it in git.
There will be a separate download later.
