# Command-line tools

GraphANNIS comes with some helper command-line tools.
The `annis` binary is a general tool to import corpora and perform queries on them using an interactive command-line.
As a replacement for the previous Java-based REST service, you can use the `graphannis-webservice` executable, which implements a complete web-service for administration and querying of corpora.
