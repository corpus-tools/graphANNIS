# Data model

The data model and concepts used by graphANNIS are similar to the ones of [Salt](http://corpus-tools.org/salt/) (see the [Salt model guide](https://github.com/korpling/salt/raw/master/gh-site/doc/salt_modelGuide.pdf) for more information).
Historically, Salt and ANNIS with its query language AQL have been developed in parallel, sharing concepts and ideas
how a linguistic corpus should be modelled as a graph.
