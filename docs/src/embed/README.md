# How to embed into applications

GraphANNIS was developed as a new backend for the ANNIS linguistic search and visualization system but can be embedded
into other applications as well.
It provides an API to add annotation graphs, querying them with AQL and retrieving subgraphs for matches.
This chapter is a tutorial in to how to embed graphANNIS into your own application.

Currently, graphANNIS can be embedded into programs written in these programming languages:
- [Python (version 3.6 or later)](./python.md)
- [Java (version 8 or later)](./java.md)
- [Rust](./rust.md)
- C (No tutorial yet)
